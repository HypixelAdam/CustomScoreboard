# Custom Scoreboard Plugin
A plugin I made a long time ago, but don't use it, it may be defective for recent versions, ( Bukkit 1.8 )

# Description
It was a plugin that I originally made for a server but that server had closed down so I decided, "why not upload it to GitHub?" Well,
here I am. I had nothing else to do with this plugin so I wanted to just upload it and keep it there for lookbacks for other things

# What is it?
Its a scoreboard plugin that allows you to customize your scoreboard with other settings such as the players current location and
the players name. If I do decided to continue this plugin, there will be more added to the plugin.

# Why upload it if it's a older version?
It would take a very long time to go through everything and update it to the recent version so im uploading the 1.8 messy version and I'll
make a more easier, smaller version when I get the chance (maybe).

## Feel free to ask me any questions! I'm open to them at anytime and I don't check frequently so you're probably going to wait a bit.
